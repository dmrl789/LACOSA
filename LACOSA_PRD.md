## 1. Vision & Purpose

**Problem**  
Moving to a new city is overwhelming — safety is uncertain, schools and housing are hard to evaluate, cultural and social life is hidden, and local online groups are fragmented and often unreliable.

**Solution**  
**LACOSA** is an AI-powered, community-augmented app that gives newcomers a trusted, interactive guide to any city. It combines **live safety insights, family and lifestyle resources, housing, culture, and social networking** with an **AI concierge** that can answer local questions in natural language and multiple languages.

**Primary Users**
- Expats, digital nomads, remote workers relocating or traveling medium-term.
- Families moving abroad with kids.
- International students.
- Long-stay tourists.

**Value Proposition**
- Arrive and integrate faster with **actionable local intelligence**.
- Make **safer, better living decisions** (housing, schools, transport).
- Connect with **like-minded expats/nomads** and local trusted providers.
